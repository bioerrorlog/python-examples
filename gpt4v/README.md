The image shows a workspace with various items laid out on top of a desk. Due to the orientation of the image, everything seems to be sideways. On the left, there's a coffee mug with a handle oriented towards the ground given the perspective of the photo. Next to it, there appears to be a laptop in the background, partially visible, with a black surface. 

In the middle of the image is a compact keyboard with black keys, lacking a numeric pad which is typical of a tenkeyless design. The keyboard is placed on top of a wooden wrist rest that matches its width, suggesting it is an accessory meant to provide ergonomic support while typing.

On the right side, there are two computer mice, one labeled "logi", which is a shorthand for Logitech, a well-known manufacturer of computer peripherals. Both mice seem to be of the standard two-button with scroll-wheel design, with one mouse being gray and the other being red.

There appears to be some cluttered cables in the upper left corner which can be associated with typical electronic device usage, such as charging cables, power cords, or peripheral connections. The overall perspective of the room and the position of the objects suggest that the image was taken either hastily or without attention to the camera angle, which has resulted in the tilted view.
